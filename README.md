<h1> Welcome to the Conjugator!</h1>

<p> <u>This page is still a work in progress, so please come back at a later date.</u> </p>
<p> To summarise, this project is for my NEA in OCR A-Level Computer Science. </p>
<p> It should do these things, by the time it ends: </p>
<ol> 
  <li> Allow users to complete conjugation exercises </li>
  <li> Have data stored about these exercises on the database </li>
  <li> Login and registration </li>
  <li> And other things... </li>
</ol>
